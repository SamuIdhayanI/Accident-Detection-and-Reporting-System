# Accident Detection and Reporting System

This project is a deep learning model that detects road accidents using CCTV camera footage. The model, built on the YOLO architecture, identifies accidents and assesses their severity. Once an accident is detected, the information is displayed on a webpage, and immediate alerts are sent to nearby hospitals, police stations, fire stations, and municipalities. The stored data can also be used for future research and studies.

### Problem Statement

Road accidents are a significant cause of injuries and fatalities worldwide. Rapid response is crucial to minimize the impact of accidents, but delays in detection and reporting can hinder emergency services' ability to provide timely assistance. Current systems often rely on manual reporting, which can be slow and unreliable.

### Solution Provided by This Project
This project provides an automated accident detection and reporting system that uses deep learning to monitor CCTV footage for road accidents. The system offers the following solutions:

- Real-Time Detection: Uses a YOLO model to detect accidents in real-time.
- Severity Assessment: Evaluates the severity of the detected accident.
- Immediate Alerts: Sends notifications to nearby hospitals, police stations, fire stations, and municipalities.
- Webpage Display: Displays detected accidents and their details on a webpage.
- Data Storage: Stores accident data for future research and analysis.

### Target Audience
- **Emergency Services:** Hospitals, police stations, fire stations, and municipalities that need timely information about road accidents.
- **Researchers and Academics:** Individuals and institutions interested in studying road accident patterns and developing safety measures.
- **City Planners and Government Agencies:** Authorities responsible for road safety and infrastructure planning.

### Features
- YOLO-Based Detection: Utilizes a YOLO deep learning model for accurate and efficient accident detection.
- Severity Assessment: Analyzes the severity of detected accidents to prioritize response efforts.
- Real-Time Alerts: Sends immediate notifications to relevant emergency services.
- Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly webpage to display accident information and alerts.
- Data Storage and Analysis: Stores accident data for future research and studies to improve road safety.
